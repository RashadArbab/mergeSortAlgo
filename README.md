mergesSortedFiles

This project was a homework assignment from school, where I had to create the merge algorithm that **takes two sorted files compares the integers and them merges them to create a third sorted file.**
I am mainly just uploading so I can have a reset button I don't think anyone will find this super cool or useful, maybe a more fully fleshed out version with the sorting in it would be quite nice.

This algorithm for merging is quite good, it runs on **nTime and requires no extra resources**
